# ✈️ AirVentureLogin

**AirVentureLogin** is a Python desktop GUI application built with [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) that simulates a flight booking experience. It includes secure login and account creation screens, leading into a home page with region-based flight recommendations, interactive UI, and visual previews for popular destinations.  

This project was created for practice and exploration of UI/UX, event handling, tooltips, and modular app design in Python.
